Engage-Publish
==============

This is a Fork of the Engage Publish module found at https://github.com/EngageSoftware/Engage-Publish

Though this fork was created many years ago as I was the original creator of the module, after I left Engage I kept my own project going for my personal sites. Now that they have open sourced their modules, I've decided to put my code out on github. I wouldn't recommend that you use this, but it is avialble.

Key differences
Removed AjaxControlToolkit (haven't replaced all the functionality)
Added a "Human" check for comment display, basically users have to type the word Human in order to pass verification
Removed comment functionality from modal popup and displaying inline on the page
Migrating layout to Bootstrap
